# TinkerMill_Holiday_lights
These files will provide a jumping off point for creating cool animations in the 380 Main Street TinkerMill Holiday Display
I have not, for security reasons (although insignificant in this situation) included the credentials file - please contact CE directly if you need this info

The additional files are zipped versions of subsequent animations:

ESP32_LED_Control_new_years.zip - version started Jan 5

valentines_1.zip - version to load during Member Meeting Jan 9
